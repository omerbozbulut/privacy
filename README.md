Rock Identifier ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your data is processed when you use our application.

1. Data Collection and Usage
Photos and Camera Access: To provide our core feature of rock identification, we request permission to access your camera or photo gallery. Selected photos are securely transmitted to our AI servers for the sole purpose of identification. We do not store your photos permanently on our servers; they are discarded once the identification process is complete. The original photos remain stored only on your local device.

Location Data: Our application does not collect, track, or store your location data in any way.

Subscription Information: All subscription transactions are handled via the Apple App Store (In-App Purchase). Your payment information (e.g., credit card details) is processed directly by Apple; we do not have access to or store this information.

Analytics and Usage Data: Anonymous usage statistics may be collected to improve app performance and diagnose technical issues.

2. Data Sharing
We do not sell your data to third parties. Your photos are only temporarily shared with our AI infrastructure providers for the purpose of identification. No personally identifiable information is shared during this process.

3. Data Security
All data transfers between your device and our servers are protected using strong encryption methods, such as SSL/TLS.

4. Children’s Privacy
Our application does not knowingly collect personal data from children under the age of 13.
